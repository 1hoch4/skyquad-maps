#Skyquad Maps
Plan your flight routes for your [SkyQuad](http://1hoch4.de/) quadrotor on your Android smartphone.

#REQUIREMENTS
[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) with target platform *google api version 8* (also known as android 2.2) 
[Eclipse with ADT Plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) (optional) - my current IDE and development enviroment

#SETUP
Here is my workflow:
* install the requirements
* import the project into eclipse (File -> Import -> File System)
* import the test project in the root directory as an seperate project
* hit the build button
I tried maven, but it seems overkill for me.

#BUGS
The programm is currently under heavy development and not in a useable state. Wait a month if you want to use it or help me get it working.
